/* endinconv.c -- Endian conversions utilities.
 *
 * This functions are never called directly, but always using the macros
 * defined into endianconv.h, this way we define everything is a non-operation
 * if the arch is already little endian.
 *
 * Discnt tries to encode everything as little endian (but a few things that need
 * to be backward compatible are still in big endian) because most of the
 * production environments are little endian, and we have a lot of conversions
 * in a few places because ziplists, intsets, zipmaps, need to be endian-neutral
 * even in memory, since they are serialied on DDB files directly with a single
 * write(2) without other additional steps.
